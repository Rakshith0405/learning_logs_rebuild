# ⚠️ Important Notice for Evaluators ⚠️

## Limited-Time Codespace Availability
Since GitHub Codespaces has a limited active time, I have deployed the `/htop` endpoint in my **previous Django project, which is also hosted on AWS**.
although it is not the main branch, i created a seperate branch for the purpose of the assessment.
and made changes to my existing django project.  

### 📌 How to Access the `/htop` Endpoint:
✅ **Live URL:** https://organic-guacamole-j65wjvrxrxg25qw6-8000.app.github.dev/htop/
✅ **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/Rakshith0405/learning_logs_rebuild

### 📝 What This Endpoint Displays:
- **Name**: Rakshith  
- **Username**: System username  
- **Server Time**: Displayed in IST  
- **Top Output**: First 10 lines of system resource usage  


  
Thank you! 🙌
